# Docker and Docker Compose

## Introduction

Docker is a platform that allows developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, stand-alone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Installation

Here's a high-level guide to installing Docker and Docker Compose on a Linux system.

### Docker Installation

Update your existing list of packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Start and enable Docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Verify that Docker is installed correctly by running a test image:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

### Docker Compose Installation

Download the current stable release of Docker Compose:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Apply executable permissions to the binary:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Apply executable permissions to the binary:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

This should display the version of Docker Compose that you've installed.

## Conclusion

Docker and Docker Compose are powerful tools for managing and deploying applications. They allow you to package your application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This makes it easier to manage and deploy applications, as you can ensure that your application will run the same way, regardless of the environment it's deployed to.
